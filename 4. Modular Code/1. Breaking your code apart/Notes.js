//functions in JavaScript
function myFunction() //parenthesis is there to give a placehold in case data needs to be passed through
{
	alert("This code is inside the function");
	// loops, if statements, anything!
	// ...
}
//somtime later
myFunction();
//Calling a function will execute all the code inside the function
//If a function is created then it won't be done automatically, you have to call it yourself
