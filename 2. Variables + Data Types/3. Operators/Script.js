//Arithmetic Operators
// + - * /
//if
	var a = 100;
	var b = 50;
	var result = a/b;
//the variable result would then become the answer/computation of the two variables via operators

//Operator precedence exists
//if
//result = 5 + 5 * 10;
//Multiplication would be done first, then addition; resulting in the result being = 55
//(5+5)*100 = 100

//score = score + 10
//the variable added by 10 would be stored as that variable
//shortcut -> +=
//exists for other operators ->  +=, -=, *=, /=
//a = a + 1; also can be written as a += 1; or even shorter:
//a++;
//this ads 1
//vice versa is a--
